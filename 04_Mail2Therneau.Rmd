Dear Mr. Therneau,

We are contacting you as two student assistants at the Georg-August University in Göttingen (Germany). At the moment we are investigating how narcissism is associated with the entry and the dissolution of romantic relationships. To analyze our longitudinal data , we are using survival analyses or. the coxph-function. 

Because our main predictors (narcissism and its sub-dimensions based on the NARQ-questionnaire) are continous we are struggling with interpreting our results. 

1. Is our interpretation correct based on the given output?

###############################
Call:
coxph(formula = Surv(single_start_d, relationship_start_d, event) ~ 
    NARQ_ADM + cluster(session), data = surv_data)

  n= 935, number of events= 371 

            coef exp(coef) se(coef) robust se     z Pr(>|z|)    
NARQ_ADM 0.28334   1.32755  0.08085   0.07998 3.542 0.000396 ***

NARQ_ADM     1.328     0.7533     1.135     1.553

Concordance= 0.528  (se = 0.017 )
Rsquare= 0.013   (max possible= 0.992 )
Likelihood ratio test= 12.17  on 1 df,   p=5e-04
Wald test            = 12.55  on 1 df,   p=4e-04
Score (logrank) test = 12.3  on 1 df,   p=5e-04,   Robust = 11.66  p=6e-04

"One raised unit of NARQ_ADM is associated with 1.33 higher probability of the event (i.g. starting a relationship)."


2. Would you recommend a different approach for continous data?

3. Can you recommend a good way of plotting our results (because Kaplan-Meier-curves are hard to interpret)?

Best regards,
Laura Botzet & Sarah Forsthoff
